# Classification-model-to-Predict-Grade
Build a Classification model to predict grade for candidates and share the predicted grades for the given test data.

Data comprises of certain candidates from certain federations participating in certain events and have been graded on the same. Other datasets are GDP and population data country wise.
•	Federation Data.csv

•	world_gdp.csv

•	world_pop.csv

•	Train_data.csv

•	Test_data.csv

In this notebook, we carried out the first below steps of a machine learning problem:

1.Cleaned and formatted the raw data

2.Performed an exploratory data analysis

3.Developed a set of features to train our model using feature engineering and feature selection

4.Prediction of Grades has been done considering classification problem (Class A, B, C and D)


**For classification, we have used Support vector classifier Random forestand and KNN model without considering the PCA**
